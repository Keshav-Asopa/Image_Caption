# Image_Caption
Here I created the model that will generate the caption(Textual description) for a given photograph.

# Dataset Link
Images data --> https://github.com/jbrownlee/Datasets/releases/download/Flickr8k/Flickr8k_Dataset.zip

# Model
Main code is in the main.ipynb file. We are using CNNs and RNNs to make the model.
First we have CNNs to undestand the image and Texts will be analyzed by RNNs.
